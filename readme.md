# Instructions for XHR Chart

## Download this repo to your local machine

## Installing node-modules and running the code

`cd` into server/ and run `npm i` to install the necessary node dependencies.

run `node server` from inside server/ to spin up the chart on localhost:3000

## Creating the chart
Go to the [https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html] (FSU CSV data page)

Choose a data set that you can derive (discover) a clear X and Y axis.

For example, there is a csv file of the rotten tomato scores of the actor Robert Deniro.

You could make a chart of his highest rotten tomato score by year.

Create a .csv file in the data/ folder and format the data in such a way that the first column of data has an heading for the X-axis data and the second column has a heading for the y-axis data.

Make sure to change the labels in the javascript code accordingly to best visualize the data on the page.

You can look at the documentation for [https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html](chart.js) for tips.
